# BestBowlerAtDeathOvers
Analyzing the best bowlers at IPL till IPL 2022 and finding the approach that works best.

We have some brilliant insights to clearly demarcate 2 styles of death bowling that work: 
1. Choke runs and slow down the game.
2. Take wickets and expose lesser able batsmen to hit.

Approach 1 is the case of Nortje,Bumrah, Deepak Chahar and Arshdeep Singh who've managed to bowl the highest percentage of non-boundary balls in death, which directly translates to lower team totals than expected.

Approach 2 is the case of Shami, Rabada, Morris, Holder and Harshal Patel who've managed to bowl the highest percentage of wicket-taking deliveries in death, which brings in newer batsmen to crease and newer batsmen are more susceptible to throw wickets away in pursuit of scoring without being set, to keep up the tempo of the game. 

Also, a cluster of seasoned death bowlers of Bravo, Sam Curran, Andrew Tye, Trent Boult are at the sweet spot of both, who've managed to take wickets as well as bowl high percentage of non-boundary balls.
